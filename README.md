  # to-do

    Discordbot(ircbot), grab all messages from #channel and forward to connected IRC channel.  
    .add - grab RSS feeds by list.txt and forward to #channel.  

  c. Twitter giveaway-bot. RT any tweet fulfilling requirements of a list of keywords to crawl for. i.e 'giveaway' 'retweet for *foo*'..

  d. Hardware copy-buffert module for keyboard(s): Store clipboard data on chip-device for transfer between devices.  
  (Example: Bluetooth keyboard connected to two devices.)

  e. Alien adoption agency / Pokémon GO / Google Maps: Game design with intent of outdoorsy stuff.

Google maps/earth points of interests as messageboards ingame.  

  f. Clickable Chrometabs which opens a 'folder'.  
  (I.e current chrometabs but onClick a dropdown list shows.)  

  g. Blizzard's Overwatch RAM access for connection Spotify and Overwatch.exe between. Such that specific playlists are played depending on what Map/Level is being played on Overwatch.
